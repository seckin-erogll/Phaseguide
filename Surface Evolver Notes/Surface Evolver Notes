The basic operation of the Evolver is to read in a datafile and take commands from the user. 

The main command prompt is
     Enter command:

The most common commands are one letter (case is significant for these), sometimes with a numerical parameter. The most frequently used commands are:
     g n     do n iterations  ('g' is for 'go')
     r       refine the triangulation of surface 
     P       graphics output (option 8 for geomview, option 3 for PostScript)
     s       show surface on screen (Evolver's own simple graphics)
     q       quit 

An iteration is one evolution step. The motion for the step is calculated as follows: First, the force on each vertex is calculated from the gradient of the total energy 
of the surface as a function of the position of that vertex. The force gives the direction of motion. Second, the force is made to conform to whatever constraints are applicable.
Third, the actual motion is found by multiplying the force by a global scale factor.
