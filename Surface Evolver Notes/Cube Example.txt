A sample datafile cube.fe comes with Evolver.
 The initial surface is a unit cube. 
 The surface bounds one body, and the body is constrained to have volume 1. 
 There is no gravity or any other force besides surface tension. 
 Hence the minimal energy surface will turn out to be a sphere.
 
  This example illustrates the basic datafile format and some basic commands.
